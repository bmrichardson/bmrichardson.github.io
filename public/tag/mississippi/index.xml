&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, April 20, 2020, I successfully defended my doctoral research! In the midst of the COVID-19 lockdown, the defense was completely virtual (other than one of my co-advisors being in the room). Other than a couple of small audio issues, everything went swimmingly! (Get it?! fish….swimmingly…..ok, you get it!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presentation lasted right at an hour with a some great questions coming from those that attended. Immediately after the presentation my committee and I sat down for the virtual closed-door session. There were a few butterflies at the start but after a couple of questions I regained my confidence and coasted through most of the session. We discussed a few things we wanted to improve on the dissertation but, overall, the committee was very happy with where we were at and what we had accomplished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, my final summer as a PhD student just wrapped up and I have to say I’m pretty happy with how it turned out. This summer led to a wide range of new experiences, projects, and results. I have begun a collaboration with a parasitologist in the Mississippi State vet school, investigating trematode morphometrics for species identification. The parasitologist believes he has found several specimens that have been mis-identified, which has led to an artificial reduction in the diversity of this parasite genus. So, we are teaming up for a project using morphometrics and molecular data to determine the true identifications and (hopefully) update the key for this genus. After seeing the potential in this morphometric method, he has also mentioned looking at the morphometrics of some other organisms he has, so there will be much more to come on this topic in the future!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned in the project description of my &lt;em&gt;Aeromonas&lt;/em&gt; work, we are currently working with two different strains/genotypes of virulent &lt;em&gt;Aeromonas hydrophila&lt;/em&gt;. Dealing with multiple strains of a bacteria can prove difficult with creating vaccines or administering antibiotics so we wanted to see how the temporal distribution of these two strains compared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, we analyzed the isolates from various cases using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and electrophoresis. The image below shows what a typical electrophoresis gel looks like and how to read it. Each white band is a specific disease case and the location of each band tells us what strain of bacteria was collected from a specific case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/2019/images/electrophoresis-gel.png&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using isolates collected from diseased catfish in the Mississippi Delta from 2013 (a year before the S14 strain was collected) to 2017, a very interesting pattern emerged. In less than 5 years, the new S14 strain made up 100% of all virulent Aeromonas cases (see figure below)!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/2019/images/temporal-shift.png&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned before, this could have important implications for people working to create a vaccine or administering antibiotics because there is no guarantee that the medications will work on both strains!&lt;/p&gt;
