      <title>A Strange Reality</title>

      <description>


&lt;p&gt;Today has placed me in a strange reality, yet it is also a fairly common one across much of the academic world. Just over 3 months ago, I defended my doctoral research. Since then I have been writing manuscripts, making dissertation edits, submitting documents to the library, and continuing active projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of June 1st, my doctoral funding was up but my advisor was kind enough to find another project to work on that had funds that could float me for about a month. So, as July approached, I became anxious as I hadn’t heard from any of the jobs I applied to and was left in a bit of a limbo as far as what my next step would be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, I still have not heard back from any positions and I have officially turned in the keys to my apartment since my lease was up (I allowed the lease to expire because I know my next position will not be in Starkville). So, as of lunchtime today, I hold a Ph.D. (ABD) in Wildlife and Fisheries, and I am both &lt;em&gt;unemployed&lt;/em&gt; as well as &lt;em&gt;homeless&lt;/em&gt;. Now, that is not to say that I don’t have anywhere to stay/sleep. I have several fantastic friends across multiple states that are happy to help me out until I get my feet under me, and to them I am forever greatful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this strange reality is one that hits home with me and is something that I think many people often overlook. There is a common misconception that once you obtain your Ph.D. “the world is your oyster”, as it were, but that isn’t always the case. Professor and advanced research positions are just as competitive as any other job/career and the projects we are a part of during our schooling typically have hard timetables. So when the deadline hits, the funding is up. And if one of your connections can’t find a project for you work on, or a short-term position, your source of income dries up immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typically, graduate students are already job-searching before their fuding runs out, which is great practice. This is something that I had also done but the hiring process is taking longer than it typically would (due in part to the COVID-19 crisis). So, I guess the take-away from this post is a nudge to reach out to your friends/family that have graduated, or will be in the coming weeks, just to check on them and see how things are going. Because I am sure there are many who, like me, had taken steps to transition more seemlessly into their next position but that may have been disrupted. So a simple check-in and the chance to catch up with an old friend may be a small but hugely important part of their day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, April 20, 2020, I successfully defended my doctoral research! In the midst of the COVID-19 lockdown, the defense was completely virtual (other than one of my co-advisors being in the room). Other than a couple of small audio issues, everything went swimmingly! (Get it?! fish….swimmingly…..ok, you get it!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presentation lasted right at an hour with a some great questions coming from those that attended. Immediately after the presentation my committee and I sat down for the virtual closed-door session. There were a few butterflies at the start but after a couple of questions I regained my confidence and coasted through most of the session. We discussed a few things we wanted to improve on the dissertation but, overall, the committee was very happy with where we were at and what we had accomplished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, my final summer as a PhD student just wrapped up and I have to say I’m pretty happy with how it turned out. This summer led to a wide range of new experiences, projects, and results. I have begun a collaboration with a parasitologist in the Mississippi State vet school, investigating trematode morphometrics for species identification. The parasitologist believes he has found several specimens that have been mis-identified, which has led to an artificial reduction in the diversity of this parasite genus. So, we are teaming up for a project using morphometrics and molecular data to determine the true identifications and (hopefully) update the key for this genus. After seeing the potential in this morphometric method, he has also mentioned looking at the morphometrics of some other organisms he has, so there will be much more to come on this topic in the future!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned in the project description of my &lt;em&gt;Aeromonas&lt;/em&gt; work, we are currently working with two different strains/genotypes of virulent &lt;em&gt;Aeromonas hydrophila&lt;/em&gt;. Dealing with multiple strains of a bacteria can prove difficult with creating vaccines or administering antibiotics so we wanted to see how the temporal distribution of these two strains compared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, we analyzed the isolates from various cases using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and electrophoresis. The image below shows what a typical electrophoresis gel looks like and how to read it. Each white band is a specific disease case and the location of each band tells us what strain of bacteria was collected from a specific case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/2019/images/electrophoresis-gel.png&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using isolates collected from diseased catfish in the Mississippi Delta from 2013 (a year before the S14 strain was collected) to 2017, a very interesting pattern emerged. In less than 5 years, the new S14 strain made up 100% of all virulent Aeromonas cases (see figure below)!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/2019/images/temporal-shift.png&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned before, this could have important implications for people working to create a vaccine or administering antibiotics because there is no guarantee that the medications will work on both strains!&lt;/p&gt;
