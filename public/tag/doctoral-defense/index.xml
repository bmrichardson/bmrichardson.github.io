&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, April 20, 2020, I successfully defended my doctoral research! In the midst of the COVID-19 lockdown, the defense was completely virtual (other than one of my co-advisors being in the room). Other than a couple of small audio issues, everything went swimmingly! (Get it?! fish….swimmingly…..ok, you get it!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presentation lasted right at an hour with a some great questions coming from those that attended. Immediately after the presentation my committee and I sat down for the virtual closed-door session. There were a few butterflies at the start but after a couple of questions I regained my confidence and coasted through most of the session. We discussed a few things we wanted to improve on the dissertation but, overall, the committee was very happy with where we were at and what we had accomplished.&lt;/p&gt;
