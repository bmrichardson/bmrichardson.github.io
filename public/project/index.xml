      <title>Macroinvertebrate diversity in catfish production ponds</title>
      <link>/project/ponddiv/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Approximately 50% of U.S.-raised catfish production takes place in the state of Mississippi. Catfish production occurs in earthen ponds where many natural processes still occur. With this production setup, natural pond inhabitants must be included in the understanding of the pond environment and how their presence, behaviors, and ecology effect the production of catfish. Many macroinvertebrates can be nuisance species at various periods within the production cycle. For instance, dragonfly nymphs can heavily predate on catfish fry after stocking of ponds for fingerling production. Meanwhile, other macroinvertebrates serve as intermediate hosts to parasites that subsequently infect the catfish. These parasites can cause nearly 100% mortality of a pond population in severe cases. Thus, it is important to understand the ecology of the macroinvertebrates and what roles they play in the produciton pond environment as to create better management strategies for catfish farmers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project is a small piece of a larger project aiming to investigation snail ecology, seasonal movement, and timing of parasitism. The subsection of the project hopes to fill a knowledge gap in the literature and understanding of the catfish production pond. A multitude of studies have investigated phytoplankton diversity and the effects of different groups on the production cycle; however, little information exists on the macroinvertebrate community and how these species may alter, facilitate, or antagonize processes within the pond that may be important to production. A better understanding of the macroinvertebrate diversity and their functions could provide new insights and management strategies that utilize natural pond ecology to improve catfish production.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Diet Comparison of Four Sympatric Gar Species</title>
      <link>/project/gar/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In 2009, the Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources (KDFWR) committed to the reintroduction of Alligator Gar to western Kentucky. The initial project consisted of a 5-year program to stock age-0 Alligator Gar into selected rivers. All stocked fish were implanted with a 2.2 mm microwire tag near the dorsal fin to aid in identification. The microwire can be used to identify hatchery-raised fish at a later date and help provide evidence of natural reproduction in years to come. The aim of these reintroductions is to return this predator to sustainable populations throughout its entire native home range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This research project aimed to evaluate the diet overlap of the reintroduced Alligator Gar and 3 close relatives that inhabit the same waters of the Lower Mississippi River. We used gill nets to collect gar, then examined the stomach contents to compare the diets of the four sympatric gar species.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Biocontrol of Proliferative Gill Disease using Gambusia</title>
      <link>/project/pgd/</link>

      <guid>/project/pgd/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Proliferative Gill Disease (PGD) is a prominant disease concern in catfish aquaculture of the southeastern United States and is the third leading disease found in the Delta region of Mississippi. In an effort to mitigate the effects of PGD, we have evaluated the efficacy of stocking &lt;em&gt;Gambusia&lt;/em&gt; spp. at various densities to serve as a dead-end host for the &lt;em&gt;Henneguya ictaluri&lt;/em&gt; parasite. Previous research has shown that fish mucous from multiple species can activate attachment of the parasite, even if the fish is not a viable host.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Morphometric Analysis of Trematode Parasites</title>
      <link>/project/trematodes/</link>

      <guid>/project/trematodes/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Identification of parasite taxa can be difficult and is often based on a limited number of specimens. A combination of morphology, life cycle host(s), distribution, and/or genetics are often used to classify novel species. Our research is using morphometric analysis to confirm taxon identification within the &lt;em&gt;Apharyngostrigea&lt;/em&gt; genus as well as develop specific morphometrics that can be used to rapidly differentiate among species.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Atypical Aeromonas hydrophila in Catfish</title>
      <link>/project/aeromonas/</link>

      <guid>/project/aeromonas/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Commercial aquaculture is a global, multibillion dollar industry in a constant battle about disease and pathogens. Commercial catfish production has been fighting an atypical strain of the bacterium, &lt;em&gt;Aeromonas hydrophila&lt;/em&gt; (aAh), in the southeastern United States since the late 2000s. Atypical &lt;em&gt;A. hydrophila&lt;/em&gt; outbreaks range from chronic to acute and can cause losses totaling 10,000+ kg in only a few days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The disease ecology and outbreak risk factors are poorly understood. Potential predictor variables have included phytoplankton blooms, nitrogenous waste build-up, water temperatures, and many others. However, the high variability in water quality and plankton communities and densities of earthen aquaculture ponds makes prediction of outbreaks more difficult and no study, to date, has been able to consistently predict vAh outbreaks within aquaculture ponds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project aims to investigate vAh prevalence and risk factors associated with acute outbreaks in commercial catfish ponds. The project will examine the new strain of &lt;em&gt;A. hydrophila&lt;/em&gt; from a bacterium, better profiling the isolates collected from sick fish at two fish health diagnostic labs. An emphasis of this project is understanding the dynamics of the catfish aquaculture pond. Knowledge accrued from an overall systems model can then be used to inform decisions and variables used in an epidemiology model. By focusing on the environment as well as the pathogen and host, the study moves toward true eco-epidemiology and provides a better overall understanding of the emerging pathogen and its ecology.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Catalpa/Red Bud Creek</title>
      <link>/project/catalpa/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Catalpa/Red Bud Creek is a small stream that flows through the Mississippi State University campus, past the MSU Veterinary School facility, several agricultural research pastures, and the aquaculture research facility before ultimately draining into Tibbee Creek, which serves as a tributary to the Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway. The section of Catalpa Creek that flows past the MSU Veterinary School is prone to high flows and flash floods during heavy rain events. The stream can also receive high volumes of impervious surface run-off and drain overflows from the vet school facility. These disturbance events and the potential for point- and non-point-source contaminants raises many concerns when discussing the health of the stream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project is a collaboration between members of the MSU Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering (CCE) and myself to investigate the health of Catalpa Creek and evaluate any mitigation needs. My role in this collaboration is, primarily, to serve as the expert in stream ecology and aquatic macroinvertebrates. We are using standard methods to sample and evaluate macroinvertebrate communities to help assess stream health. In addition to macroinvertebrate sampling, members of the MSU CEE are monitoring water quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project has been a joint effort from faculty, research associates, graduate and undergraduate students, and volunteers. The ultimate goal of this project is to maintain and/or restore the integrity of Catalpa Creek and create a wetland education center in this area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are interested in this project, you can find more information from one of the collaborators

      <title>Magby Creek Outreach</title>
      <link>/project/magby/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 16 Nov 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Magby Creek is a small stream that flows near the Columbus High School (Columbus, MS). The stream has been heavily channelized and managed in some parts; however, the portion of the stream that this project focuses on is relatively unaltered. Aside from commercial and residential architecture near by, the stream has wide meanders, a low gradient, a riparian buffer that is mostly intact, and a good mix of gravel, sand, and silt substrates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2017, Ms. Pounders, a biology teacher at Columbus HS, was interested in building a long-term project that could provide her students (primarily under-represented, urban children) with real hands-on opportunities to apply the scientific knowledge they have learned in the classroom. She wanted something that could provide new experiences for the students and get them excited about biology, possibly showing them another avenue to college and/or a career. So Ms. Pounders and a small group of her students went to a water quality training workshop at the University of Maine to learn the techniques that they could apply to the small stream that flows near their school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was contacted by a mutual friend, who is also a Mississippi State University faculty member, to see if I would be willing to help with the project she had in mind. The project was originally going to include monitoring water quality of Magby Creek, including flow rate, dissolved oxygen, pH, and other parameters. During our first field day together, I mentioned also sampling aquatic macroinvertebrates and teaching the students how to use the Pollution Tolerance Index (PTI). This was another opportunity for the students to experience something they had likely never seen (or even thought about)&amp;hellip;AQAUTIC BUGS!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the beginning of this partnership, student ideas/projects have flourished! Most students use some piece of this research as their science fair projects while others help monitor the stream while focusing on other science topics for their projects. During our first year, the 5 students that worked on the project showed exceptional growth in confidence, critical thinking, and content information retention. In addition, they submitted three Science Fair projects; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;2 projects won 1st place in their respective categories&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and the five students earned &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;11 special recognition awards!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
