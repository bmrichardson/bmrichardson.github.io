I am a Research Fish Biologist with the USDA-ARS Warmwater Aquaculture Research Unit. My research primarily centers on the ecology of snails and other macroinvertebrates in catfish aquaculture ponds and how this subsequently impacts catfish production. My research interests cover a wide breadth of aquatic ecology including macroinvertebrate and fish community structures, species interactions, predator-prey interactions, as well as general ecology and life histories. I also have a strong interest in educational research, particularly in how note-taking effects information retention in the classroom.
