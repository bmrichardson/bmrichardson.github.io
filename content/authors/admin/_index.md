I am a doctoral graduate from the Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Aquaculture at Mississippi State University. My dissertation research focused on the eco-epidemiology of a bacterial pathogen in farm-raised Channel Catfish (_Ictalurus punctatus_) of Mississippi and surrounding states. My research interests cover a wide breadth of aquatic ecology including macroinvertebrate and fish community structures, species interactions, predator-prey interactions, as well as general ecology and life histories. I also have a strong interest in educational research, particularly in how note-taking effects information retention in the classroom.
