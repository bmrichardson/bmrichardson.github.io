abstract: "In the mid-2010s, *Edwardsiella tarda* was reaffiliated into three discrete taxa (*E. anguillarum*, *E. piscicida*, and *E. tarda*), obscuring previous descriptions of *E. tarda*-induced pathology in fish. To clarify ambiguity regarding the pathology of *E. tarda*, *E. piscicida*, and *E. anguillarum* infections in US farm-raised catfish, channel catfish (*Ictalurus punctatus*), blue catfish (*I. furcatus*), and channel × blue catfish hybrids were challenged with comparable doses of each bacterium. The most severe pathology and mortality occurred in fish challenged with *E. piscicida*, supporting previous reports of increased pathogenicity in commercially important ictalurids, while *E. anguillarum* and *E. tarda* warrant only minimal concern. Acute pathologic lesions among bacterial species were predominantly necrotizing and characteristic of gram-negative sepsis but became progressively granulomatous over time. After 100 days, survivors were exposed to the approximate median lethal doses of *E. piscicida* and *E. ictaluri*, revealing some cross-protective effects among *E. piscicida*, *E. anguillarum*, and *E. ictaluri*. In contrast, no fish that survived *E. tarda* challenge demonstrated any protection against *E. piscicida* or *E. ictaluri*. This work supports reports of increased susceptibility of channel, blue, and hybrid catfish to *E. piscicida*, while highlighting potential cross-protective affects among fish associated *Edwardsiella* spp."
