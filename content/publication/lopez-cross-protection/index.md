abstract: _Edwardsiella piscicida_ is a growing problem for catfish aquaculture in the southeastern United States, particularly in channel (*Ictalurus punctatus*) x blue (*I. furcatus*) catfish hybrids. Research has shown *E. piscicida* isolates recovered from farmed catfish in Mississippi form at least five discrete phyletic groups, with no apparent differences in virulence in channel and hybrid catfish. Laboratory trials have shown a live-attenuated *E. ictaluri* vaccine (340X2) cross-protects against at least one *E. piscicida* isolate (S11–285) in channel and hybrid catfish, although it is unknown if this protection exists for other *E. piscicida* variants. To this end, channel and hybrid catfish were immunized by immersion with *E. ictaluri* 340X2. Thirty days later, fish were challenged by intracoelomic injection with representative *E. piscicida* variants from each phyletic group. Relative percent survival (RPS) for hybrids ranged from 54.7% to 77.8%, while RPS in channels ranged from 80.5% to 100%. A second study investigated whether channel and hybrid catfish exposed to heterologous *E. piscicida* isolates were similarly protected against wild-type *E. ictaluri*. Fish were exposed by bath immersion to representative *E. piscicida* isolates from each phyletic group. Thirty days post-immunization, fish were challenged by immersion with wild-type *E. ictaluri* isolate S97–773. Regardless of variant, previous exposure to heterologous *E. piscicida* isolates significantly improved survival following *E. ictaluri* challenge. These findings suggest the presence of shared and conserved antigens among *E. piscicida* and *E. ictaluri* that could be exploited by application of polyvalent or cross-protective vaccines.
