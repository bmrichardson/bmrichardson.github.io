abstract: Characterising myxozoan taxa parasitising fish hosts in catfish aquaculture ponds is crucial to understanding myxozoan community dynamics in these diverse and complex ecological systems. This work investigated the myxozoan fauna of the western mosquitofish, *Gambusia affinis*, a common, incidental species found in catfish aquaculture ponds in the southeastern United States. 598 fish were sampled in May of 2018 and 2019 from the pond facility of the Thad Cochran National Warmwater Aquaculture Center in Stoneville, Mississippi, USA. Fish were examined microscopically using wet mount preparations of fresh tissue and histology for myxozoans. 18S rRNA gene sequences were amplified from myxospores obtained at necropsy. Updated morphologic, histologic, and 18S rRNA gene sequence features are provided for *Henneguya gambusi*, *Myxobolus pharyngeus*, and *Myxidium phyllium*. Two potentially novel myxozoans were observed during this survey, an undocumented Myxobolus sp. associated with chondrolysis of bones throughout the body and a putative *Myxobilatus* sp. observed histologically in the renal tubules, ureters, and urinary bladder. However, inadequate samples were obtained for proper species descriptions. Lastly, the life cycle of *M. pharyngeus*, which is thought to utilize the oligochaete worm Dero digitata as their definitive host, was putatively confirmed by 18S rRNA sequence matching to actinospore stages from oligochaetes in catfish ponds in Mississippi. This work provides novel and expanded morphologic, histologic, molecular and biologic data of five myxozoan parasites of *G. affinis*, expanding our knowledge of myxozoan diversity in catfish aquaculture ponds.
