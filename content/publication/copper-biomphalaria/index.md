abstract: Avian piscivores cause direct economic losses to the aquaculture industry through predation, as well as indirect losses through transmission of digenetic trematodes. _Bolbophorus damnificus_ is a trematode parasite associated with significant losses in catfish aquaculture. The complex life cycle involves the American white pelican _Pelecanus erythrorhynchos_, planorbid snails, and ictalurid catfish. With no approved therapeutics for _B. damnificus_ in catfish _Ictalurus_ spp. and federal protections on American white pelican, management is restricted to controlling snail hosts. Two snail species, marsh rams-horn snail _Planorbella trivolvis_ and ghost rams-horn snail _Biomphalaria havanensis_, are common inhabitants of commercial catfish ponds and known to transmit _B. damnificus_. Previous work evaluated copper sulfate toxicity on marsh rams-horn snails; however, data are lacking for ghost rams-horn snails. Herein, laboratory-reared adults of ghost rams-horn snails and marsh rams-horn snails were exposed to copper concentrations ranging from 0.16 to 3.38 mg/L Cu to evaluate 24-, 48-, and 72-h acute toxicity. Additionally, sequential low-dose treatments ranging from 0.1 to 0.8 mg/L Cu were evaluated on eggs, juveniles, and adults of ghost rams-horn snails as a potentially safer treatment regime for ponds. Acute toxicity was similar between snail species for all exposure times. A 72-h exposure produced an LC50 of 0.10 and 0.37 mg/L Cu for ghost rams-horn snails and marsh rams-horn snails, respectively. The LC~50~ values increased to 1.1 mg/L Cu for both species with 48-h exposure. However, in the multiple low-dose study, a single dose of 0.4 or 0.8 mg/L Cu was lethal to all adult snails after 1 week, as was 0.2 mg/L Cu after two doses. Four doses of 0.1 mg/L Cu or greater killed all ghost rams-horn snail juveniles. Results indicate that marsh ramshorn snails and ghost ramshorn snails have similar sensitivity to copper, and multiple low-dose treatments were effective against all life stages of ghost rams-horn snails. These data indicate that copper can be an effective treatment for snail control in commercial catfish ponds.
