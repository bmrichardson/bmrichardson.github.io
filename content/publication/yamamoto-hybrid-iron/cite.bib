abstract = {Abstract To prevent catfish idiopathic anaemia, diets fortified with iron have been adopted as a regular practice on commercial catfish farms to promote erythropoiesis. However, the effects of prolonged exposure of excess dietary iron on production performance and disease resistance for hybrid catfish (Ictalurus punctatus × I. furcatus) remains unknown. Four experimental diets were supplemented with ferrous monosulphate to provide 0, 500, 1000, and 1500 mg of iron per kg of diet. Groups of 16 hybrid catfish juveniles (~22.4 g) were stocked in each of 20, 110-L aquaria (n = 5), and experimental diets were offered to the fish to apparent satiation for 12 weeks. At the end of the study, production performance, survival, condition indices, as well as protein and iron retention were unaffected by the dietary treatments. Blood haematocrit and the iron concentration in the whole-body presented a linear increase with the increasing the dietary iron. The remaining fish from the feeding trial was challenged with Edwardsiella ictaluri. Mortality was mainly observed for the dietary groups treated with iron supplemented diets. The results for this study suggest that iron supplementation beyond the required levels does affect the blood production, and it may increase their susceptibility to E. ictaluri infection.},
