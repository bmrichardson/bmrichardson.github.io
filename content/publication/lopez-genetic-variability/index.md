abstract: The bacterium *Edwardsiella piscicida* causes significant losses in global aquaculture, particularly channel (*Ictalurus punctatus*) × blue (*I. furcatus*) hybrid catfish cultured in the south-eastern United States. Emergence of *E. piscicida* in hybrid catfish is worrisome given current industry trends towards increased hybrid production. The project objectives were to assess intraspecific genetic variability of *E. piscicida* isolates recovered from diseased channel and hybrid catfish in Mississippi; and determine virulence associations among genetic variants. Repetitive extragenic palindromic sequence-based PCR (rep-PCR) using ERIC I and II primers was used to screen 158 *E. piscicida* diagnostic case isolates. A subsample of 39 *E. piscicida* isolates, representing predominant rep-PCR profiles, was further characterized using BOX and (GTG)5 rep-PCR primers, virulence gene assessment and multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) targeting housekeeping genes *gyrb*, *pgi* and *phoU*. The MLSA provided greater resolution than rep-PCR, revealing 5 discrete phylogroups that correlated similarly with virulence gene profiles. Virulence assessments using *E. piscicida* representatives from each MLSA group resulted in 14-day cumulative mortality ranging from 22% to 54% and 63 to 72% in channel and hybrid fingerlings, respectively. Across all phylogroups, mortality was higher in hybrid catfish (p < .05), supporting previous work indicating *E. piscicida* is an emerging threat to hybrid catfish aquaculture in the south-eastern United States.
