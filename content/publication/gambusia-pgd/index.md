abstract: Proliferative gill disease (PGD), caused by the myxozoan _Henneguya ictaluri_, is an important parasitic disease in U.S. catfish aquaculture. Continuous exposure of Channel Catfish _Ictalurus punctatus_ to the actinospore stage of _H. ictaluri_ results in a severe inflammatory response at the gills, leading to morbidity and death. Previous work indicates that the chemical cues in fish mucus that are recognized by myxozoan actinospores are not host specific. Building on these findings, the potential decoy effects of nonictalurid fish to actinospores of _H. ictaluri_ were evaluated. Exposure of actinospores to gill mucus from multiple nonictalurid fishes resulted in actinospore activation for all fish species tested. Based on these findings, experimental transmission trials with potential interceptor fish were conducted. Individual Channel Catfish were co-stocked with Western Mosquitofish _Gambusia affinis_ at 0, 10, 25, or 50% of mean Channel Catfish biomass and exposed to 3,000 actinospores of _H. ictaluri_. Gill tissues were sampled at 24-h postchallenge, and parasite burden was estimated by _H. ictaluri_-specific quantitative PCR. Results revealed that Western Mosquitofish stocked at 25% and 50% of catfish biomass reduced _H. ictaluri_ DNA in Channel Catfish gills more than threefold. In a second study, catfish were exposed to pond water collected from an active PGD outbreak in the presence of Western Mosquitofish stocked at 25% of catfish biomass. Channel Catfish were sampled at 24-h and at 7-d after the last pond water exposure. At 24-h postexposure, catfish that were co-stocked with Western Mosquitofish showed significantly lower _H. ictaluri_ DNA than catfish stocked alone. This treatment effect was absent at 7-d postexposure, as parasite quantities within tissues had increased over 1,000Ã—, with marked variability. Still, results indicate that the chemical cues that activate _H. ictaluri_ actinospores are not specific to Channel Catfish. This work evinces a potential benefit of nonictalurid fish in combating _H. ictaluri_, suggesting that the presence of nonictalurid interceptor fish in catfish ponds may minimize PGD severity.
