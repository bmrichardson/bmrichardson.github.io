Proliferative Gill Disease (PGD) is a prominant disease concern in catfish aquaculture of the southeastern United States and is the third leading disease found in the Delta region of Mississippi. In an effort to mitigate the effects of PGD, we have evaluated the efficacy of stocking _Gambusia_ spp. at various densities to serve as a dead-end host for the _Henneguya ictaluri_ parasite. Previous research has shown that fish mucous from multiple species can activate attachment of the parasite, even if the fish is not a viable host.
