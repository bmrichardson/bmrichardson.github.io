  Trematode parasite outbreaks are are detrimental to the catfish aquaculture industry. _Bolbophorus damnificus_ is the most common trematode parasite encountered in southeastern US catfish production. The complex life cycle of _B. damnificus_ includes a snail (first intermediate host), catfish (second intermediate host), and the American White Pelican _Pelecanus erythrorhynchos_ (final/tertiary host). The American White Pelican is a federally-protected species, limiting the options for management, and there are currently no approved therapeutics for trematode infections in catfish. Thus, the snail is the most viable target of _B. damnificus_ management. _P. trivolvis_ and _B. havanensis_ are common cohabitants in catfish aquaculture ponds and each can serve as the snail host in the _B. damnificus_ life cycle. We are working to better understand snail populations in these ponds to better inform treatment and management plans. Additionally, we are investigating natural and chemical methods/regimens to safely control snail populations as a way of reducing _B. damnificus_ risk on catfish production facilities.
