Identification of parasite taxa can be difficult and is often based on a limited number of specimens. A combination of morphology, life cycle host(s), distribution, and/or genetics are often used to classify novel species. Our research is using morphometric analysis to confirm taxon identification within the _Apharyngostrigea_ genus as well as develop specific morphometrics that can be used to rapidly differentiate among species.
