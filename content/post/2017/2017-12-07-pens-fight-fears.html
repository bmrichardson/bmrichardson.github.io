<p><strong><em>Stop teaching students that they need to remove or hide all of their mistakes! This instills a fear of making mistakes that will also reduce the student’s willingness to try new things!</em></strong></p>

<p>Please leave a comment and let me know how you feel about this idea of moving to pens and saving pencils for special occasions, or if you agree/disagree with my view of the situation. I’d love to start a conversation on this type of thing because that is the only way we will ever make progress.</p>
